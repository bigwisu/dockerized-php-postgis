# PHP Dockerized

> Dockerized PHP development stack: Apache, PostgreSQL, PostGIS and Memcached

The Dockerized PHP gives you everything you need for developing a GIS PHP application.

## Requirements

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) (Mac and Windows only)

## Running

Set up a Docker Machine and then run:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

That's it! You can now access your configured sites via the IP address of the Docker Machine or locally if you're running a Linux flavour and using Docker natively.
